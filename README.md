## Overview:
The FairMoney Loan Performance Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to evaluate the end-to-end loan process from lead generation to disbursement, while assessing loan risk, approval rates, and disbursement performance across Nigerian states.
This project demonstrates how data storytelling and visualization can uncover operational inefficiencies, reveal growth drivers, and guide better credit decisions.

## Problem Statement
Loan platforms often face challenges in balancing growth with credit risk. Issues like poor conversion from approval to disbursement, uneven disbursement patterns across regions, and rising loan risk can affect profitability and customer satisfaction.
For FairMoney, identifying these gaps means understanding:
- Which loan products drive the most disbursement?
- Which regions carry higher risk scores?
- How effectively does the credit pipeline convert approvals into disbursements?
- What operational patterns or anomalies emerge over time?

#### 1. Loan Trend
- Loan disbursement remained stable until October 26, after which it surged by 5% daily, peaking at 52% growth on October 30.
- Indicates a strong late-month demand surge, likely due to payday or marketing influence.

#### 2. State-Level Risk
- The top 5 states have the highest average loan risk scores, requiring stricter screening and risk-based pricing strategies.

#### 3. Conversion Rate
- Only 38% of leads generated reached disbursing stage signaling significant need to optimize conversion across credit pipelines.

#### 4. Loan Drivers
Quick Loans and Salary Advances dominate the disbursement volume, together accounting for the majority of total loans.

## Recommendations:

#### 1. Strengthen Credit Pipeline Efficiency
- Review approval and disbursement workflow to identify bottlenecks.
- Introduce automated reminders and faster verification systems to reduce lead drop-off.

#### 2. Manage High-Risk Regions
-Tighten credit policy in the top 5 high-risk states.
- Use risk-based pricing or collateral adjustments for applicants in these areas.

#### 3. Optimize Product Portfolio
- Continue leveraging Quick Loans and Salary Advances but diversify with low-risk, high-retention loan types.

#### 4. Leverage Trend Insights for Campaigns
- Replicate end-of-month loan surge strategies earlier in the month to stabilize loan flow.
- Identify timing-based customer behavior patterns for better product targeting.
